        What is Translation?
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent
        target-language text.
    </h4>
    <p>
        <b>English language draws a terminological distinction</b> <i>(not all languages do)</i> between
        translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or sign-language communication between users of different
        languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language
        community.
    </p>
    <p>
        A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar, or syntax into the
        target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language
        calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Translators, including early translators of sacred
        texts, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying
        degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently, the
        rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation services and has facilitated "language
        localization".
