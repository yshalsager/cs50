        What is Translator Qualifications?
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Competent translators show the following attributes:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a very good knowledge of the language, written and spoken, from which they are translating (the source
            language);
        </li>
        <li>
            familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
        </li>
        <li>
            an excellent command of the language into which they are translating (the target language);
        </li>
        <li>
            a profound understanding of the etymological and idiomatic correlates between the two languages, including
            sociolinguistic register when appropriate; and
        </li>
        <li>
            a finely tuned sense of when to metaphrase ("translate literally") and when to paraphrase, so as to assure
            true rather than spurious equivalents between the source- and target-language texts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A competent translator is not only bilingual but bicultural. A language is not merely a collection of words and
        of rules of grammar and syntax for generating sentences, but also a vast interconnecting system of connotations
        and cultural references whose mastery, writes linguist Mario Pei, "comes close to being a lifetime job." The
        complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished
        translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a
        minimum of ten years' experience. Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person
        who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate
        between them.
